## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The present project is a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program I participate(d) in. In general I chose this dataset because I like travelling and am a extensive user of Airbnb. My goal was to dive into an Airbnb dataset of the city of Boston (I'll soon travel to this city) and on the one hand get a solid understanding for the Airbnb market there and on the other hand illustrate a first way also for other users to get a quick overview concerning the respective city by answering the following questions:
  1) What are the districts which are the most affordable ones in Boston for a stay? </br>
  2) Which equipments or amenities are most popular for guests? </br>
  3) Which factors have an influence on the price in which intensity? </br>

## File Description <a name="files"></a>
**Analysis_Airbnb.ipynb**: Notebook with the project's data analysis </br>
**data/boston_airbnb/listings.csv**: Airbnb scraped listing data for boston (2016). </br>
**data/Inside Airbnb Data Dictionary.xlsx**: Feature description of the different features in the dataset. </br>
**img/**: Image data present in the notebook / readme. </br>
